# This was sent in by a fellow named Dan O’Leary. 
# He came upon a common one-syllable, five-letter word 
# recently that has the following unique property. 
# When you remove the first letter, the remaining letters form 
# a homophone of the original word, that is a word that sounds exactly the same.
#  Replace the first letter, that is, put it back and 
# remove the second letter and the result is yet another homophone of 
# the original word. And the question is, what’s the word?

# Now I’m going to give you an example that doesn’t work. 
# Let’s look at the five-letter word, ‘wrack.’ W-R-A-C-K, 
# you know like to ‘wrack with pain.’ If I remove the first letter, 
# I am left with a four-letter word, ’R-A-C-K.’ As in, ‘Holy cow, 
# did you see the rack on that buck! It must have been a nine-pointer!’ 
# It’s a perfect homophone. If you put the ‘w’ back, and remove the ‘r,’ 
# instead, you’re left with the word, ‘wack,’ which is a real word, 
# it’s just not a homophone of the other two words.
# But there is, however, at least one word that Dan and we know of, 
# which will yield two homophones if you remove either of the first two 
# letters to make two, new four-letter words. The question is, what’s the word?
